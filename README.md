# Accessing Memory Beyond Array Bounds in C

This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: accessing memory beyond the bounds of an array.  This example shows how attempting to write to memory outside of the allocated array space can lead to undefined behavior and program crashes. The solution shows how to avoid this issue by carefully managing array indices and pointer arithmetic.
